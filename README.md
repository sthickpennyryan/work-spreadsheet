Work in progress spreadsheet to make tracking of letters, chasing letters and general information easier for myself and colleagues.

As for now, it is a work in progress and will continue as I think of things that may be helpful or are suggested. In time, I will be able to do an analysis of how many letters typed and length of letters per day. 
As well as general statistics about who I type for the most, who takes the longest to return etc. 

Iteration 1 consists of the basic premise of what the end product wants to be:
  * General information needed for work as well as some formulas to help with tracking
  * Notes on how things work in case of updating or changing
  * Spare spreadsheet as current one is only set up for 2000 rows. Current equiptment is slow and crashes on occasion.
    - previous spreadsheet's performance decreased significantly past around 2500 rows so wished to prevent issues and enable someone to
      make a new spreadsheet in a different document, without assistance, should they begin to have issues
  * Tracked figures of letters typed and total length of letters typed per day
  * Page to add letters for printing in the future


Iteration 2:
* Fixed the table to match previously recorded data that we will be swapping from, (switched the position of clinic code to the left of clinic date) resulting in easier transfer of information for printing		
* Extended column widths to mimic potential name lengths as well as other columns to more accurately reflect data lengths
* Additional columns added to calculate how many days from creation to authorisation of letters - enabling future analytics
